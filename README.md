Advanced variant support for Piggybak.

Migrate the DB `rake db:migrate`

Add `acts_as_sellable_with_variants` to any model that should have variants. You may need to add appropriate attr_accessible settings in your model as well, depending on your attribute accessibility settings.

In the admin, define option configurations and option values for each option, then create variants for your sellable instances.

Finally, add `<%= variant_cart_form(@instance) %>` to your sellable item's show page to render the cart form.
